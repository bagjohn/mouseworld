Progress

1. 	Set up a 'check_family_tree' script for running a simulation with a given simulation_number, gathering information and storing to a 'results/simulation_%simulation_number' folder
	The information includes :
	1. Per time step number of alive and unborn mice (data nad plot)
	2. Genome of each mice ever lived (data)
	3. Family tree depicting lifespan (line length), generation (color) and descendance (position in tree) of every mouse (plot)
2.	Run a test simulation on cluster with termination condition TO DEATH (Until all mice perish)
	It seems that with the current parameters mice multiply from soe point forward because simulation steps take more and more time.
	Awaiting to see simulation results
	
Decisions

1.	Parallel processing will be used only for multiple simulations and not within simulations (until help to achieve that is reached and only if necessary)
	Parallel processing framework has been set up and working for testing multiple initial conditions (position from food, header, genome) 
	in a world with a single mouse and desired food to test approaching interaction. Results discouraging which is expected as the approaching algorithm is arbitrary. 
	
To be done (with Pavlos help)

1.	Analyze 'mouseworld_cprof to see where code can be optimized
2.	Conceptual decisions on what kind of simulations to run
